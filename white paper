### Welcome to the World of Sock Coin: The Stylish Meme Coin Serving Its Community! ðŸŽ‰

Sock Coin is a collective adventure where everyone gets a lot of Socks. Imagine this: 80% of the total supply is distributed to the community! Here's how it works:

#### Token Distribution

- **50% at Free Price**: For 5 days, you can send any amount of BNB to this wallet, and based on your contribution, a percentage of Sock Coin will be allocated to you. The more you give, the more you receive, and the less likely you'll have cold feet!

- **30% in AirDrop**: Who doesn't have holey Socks or cold feet? 30% of the total supply will be airdropped to the community. The percentage you receive will depend on your initial participation. Simple and effective! Be generous, and we will be too!

- **10% Reserved for Liquidity Pools**: Once the 50% supply and the AirDrop have been distributed, liquidity pools will be created to ensure stability and smooth transactions. You will be able to trade your Sock Coins with ease.

- **5% for the Team**: Because a good team deserves its reward, 5% of the supply is reserved for those working hard to make Sock Coin a success.

- **5% for CEX**: Finally, 5% of the supply is reserved for centralized exchanges (CEX), ensuring maximum visibility and optimal accessibility.
