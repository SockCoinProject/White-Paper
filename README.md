***Welcome to the World Community MemeCoin #SockCoin!*** 🎉

SockCoin is a collective adventure where everyone gets a lot of Socks. Imagine this: 80% of the total supply is distributed to the community by private sale, Airdop & Rewards! 

### Here's how it works:

## 1. Introduction
**SockCoin ($SOCKCOIN)** is a deflationary meme-cryptocurrency built on the **BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)** standard. It combines humor, community-driven engagement, and a gamified ecosystem with **serious tokenomics** designed for long-term sustainability.

At the core of SockCoin lies the **Laundry Vault™**, an automated mechanism reinforcing liquidity and reducing supply permanently:

- **1%** of every transaction is added to the liquidity pool.  
- **1%** of every transaction is automatically **burned**, removing tokens from circulation forever.

With a fixed supply of **1 quadrillion tokens** and **no minting function**, SockCoin becomes scarcer as adoption grows — building long-term appreciation potential.

SockCoin merges the energy of meme culture with robust technical fundamentals, global community expansion, and high-level compliance.

**Upcoming Major CEX Listing — BitMart**  
- **Deposit:** Nov 25, 2025 – 3:00 PM UTC  
- **Trading:** Nov 26, 2025 – 3:00 PM UTC  
- **Withdrawal:** Nov 27, 2025 – 3:00 PM UTC  

**Audit & KYC:** SolidProof Gold Tier Verified  
**Status:** Fully Audited • Fully KYC’d • Liquidity Auto-Locked

## 2. Vision & Mission

### Vision
To build the most engaging and community-driven meme-coin ecosystem on the BEP-20 network, powered by humor, gamification, and deflationary mechanics.

### Mission
- Grow a strong and loyal **#SockArmy**.  
- Ensure long-term sustainability through **auto-liquidity** and **deflation**.  
- Offer real utility: **staking**, **NFTs**, **missions**, **mini-games**, and **rewards**.  
- Expand visibility with strategic partnerships and **CEX listings**.  
- Maintain transparency through **audits**, **public verification**, and **locked liquidity**.

## 3. Tokenomics

### Supply
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000,000,000 SOCKCOIN (1 Quadrillion)  
- **Circulating Supply:** 800,000,000,000,000 SOCKCOIN (80%)

### Distribution
- **80%** — Community distribution (Fair Launch, Private Sale, Airdrops, Staking Rewards)  
- **1%** — Airdrop post Fair Launch + vesting distribution  
- **4%** — Market Making Reserve  
- **15%** — CEX allocation, marketing, team, special reserves

## 4. Deflationary System: Laundry Vault™

The **Laundry Vault™** is the backbone of SockCoin’s sustainable value model.

### Mechanism
- **1%** fee per transaction → Automatically added to liquidity  
- **1%** fee per transaction → Automatically burned  

### Effects
- Constantly **increasing liquidity floor**  
- Continuously **decreasing circulating supply**  
- Enhanced long-term stability  
- Natural upward **price pressure** over time  

## 5. Audit, KYC & Security
